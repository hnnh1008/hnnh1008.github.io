    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
    <p> Firstly, my name is Hannah and I'm a junior attending Independence High School.
         Fun fact, my favorite animal is the hippo because they're so goofy looking! 
         However, I can't just have <em>one</em> favorite animal without naming a few others.</p>
